# webcrystal

<img src="README/logo.png" title="webcrystal icon" align="right" />

webcrystal is:

1. An HTTP proxy and web service that saves every web page accessed through it to disk.
2. An on-disk archival format for storing websites.

webcrystal is intended as a tool for archiving websites. It is also intended to be convenient to write HTTP-based and browser-based web scrapers on top of.

## Features

* Compact package: One .py file. Only one dependency (`urllib3`).
* A simple documented archival format.
* &gt;95% code coverage, enforced by the test suite.
* Friendly MIT license.
* Excellent documentation.

## Installation

* Install [Python 3].
* From a command-line terminal (Terminal on OS X, Command Prompt on Windows), run the command:

```
pip3 install webcrystal
```

[Python 3]: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Quickstart

To start the proxy run a command like:

```
webcrystal.py 9227 xkcd.wbcr http://xkcd.com/
```

Then you can visit <http://localhost:9227/> to have the same effect as visiting <http://xkcd.com/> directly, except that all requests are archived in `xkcd.wbcr/`.

When you access an HTTP resource through the webcrystal proxy for the first time, it will be fetched from the origin HTTP server and archived locally. All subsequent requests for the same resource will be returned from the archive.


## CLI

To start the webcrystal proxy:

```
webcrystal.py [--help] [--quiet] <port> <archive_dirpath> [<default_origin_domain>]
```

To stop the proxy press ^C or send a SIGINT signal to it.

### Full Syntax

```
webcrystal.py --help
```

This outputs:

```
usage: webcrystal.py [-h] [-q] port archive_dirpath [default_origin_domain]

An archiving HTTP proxy and web service.

positional arguments:
  port                  Port on which to run the HTTP proxy. Suggest 9227
                        (WBCR).
  archive_dirpath       Path to the archive directory. Usually has .wbcr
                        extension.
  default_origin_domain
                        Default HTTP domain which the HTTP proxy will redirect
                        to if no URL is specified.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -q, --quiet           Suppresses all output.
```


## HTTP API

The HTTP API is the primary API for interacting with the webcrystal proxy.

While the proxy is running, it responds to the following HTTP endpoints.

Notice that GET is an accepted method for all endpoints, so that they can be easily requested using a regular web browser. Browser accessibility is convenient for manual inspection and browser-based website scrapers.

### `GET,HEAD /`

Redirects to the home page of the default origin domain if it was specified at the CLI. Returns:

* HTTP 404 (Not Found) if no default origin domain is specified (the default) or
* HTTP 307 (Temporary Redirect) to the default origin domain if it is specified.

### `GET,HEAD /_/http[s]/__PATH__`

If in online mode (the default):

* The requested resource will be fetched from the origin server and added to the archive if:
    * (1) it is not already archived,
    * (2) a `Cache-Control=no-cache` request header is specified, or
    * (3) a `Pragma=no-cache` request header is specified.
* The newly archived resource will be returned to the client, with all URLs in HTTP headers and content rewritten to point to the proxy.
* If there was problem communicating with the origin server, returns:
    * HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway), with an HTML page that provides a link to the online version of the content.

If in offline mode:

* If the resource is in the archive, it will be returned to the client, with all URLs in HTTP headers and content rewritten to point to the proxy.
* If the resource is not in the archive, returns:
    * HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable), with an HTML page that provides a link to the online version of the content.

### `POST,GET /_online`

Switches the proxy to online mode.

### `POST,GET /_offline`

Switches the proxy to offline mode.

### `GET,HEAD /_raw/http[s]/__PATH__`

Returns the specified resource from the archive if it is already archived. Nothing about the resource will be rewritten including any URLs that appear in HTTP headers or content. The intent is that the returned resource be as close to the original response from the origin server as is practical.

If the resource is not in the archive, returns:

* HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable), with an HTML page that provides a link to the online version of the content.

### `POST,GET /_refresh/http[s]/__PATH__`

Refetches the specified URL from the origin server using the same request headers as the last time it was fetched. Returns:

* HTTP 200 (OK) if successful,
* HTTP 404 (Not Found) if the specified URL was not in the archive, or
* HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway) if there was problem communicating with the origin server.

### `POST,GET /_delete/http[s]/__PATH__`

Deletes the specified URL in the archive. Returns:

* HTTP 200 (OK) if successful, or
* HTTP 404 (Not Found) if the specified URL was not in the archive.


## Archival Format

When the proxy is started with a command like:

```
webcrystal.py 9227 website.wbcr
```

It creates an archive in the directory `website.wbcr/` in the following format:


### `website.wbcr/index.txt`

* Lists the URL of each archived HTTP resource, one per line.
* UTF-8 encoded text file with Unix line endings (`\n`).

Example:

```
http://xkcd.com/
http://xkcd.com/s/b0dcca.css
http://xkcd.com/1645/
```

The preceding example archive contains 3 HTTP resources, numbered #1, #2, and #3.


### `website.wbcr/1.request_headers.json`

* Contains the HTTP request headers sent to the origin HTTP server to obtain HTTP resource #1.
* UTF-8 encoded JSON file.

Example:

```
{"Accept-Language": "en-us", "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8", "Host": "xkcd.com", "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate", "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_3) AppleWebKit/601.4.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0.3 Safari/601.4.4"}
```


### `website.wbcr/1.response_headers.json`

* Contains the HTTP response headers received from the origin HTTP server when obtaining HTTP resource #1.
* UTF-8 encoded JSON file.
* Contains an internal "X-Status-Code" header that indicates the HTTP status code received from the origin HTTP server.

Example:

```
{"Cache-Control": "public", "Connection": "keep-alive", "Accept-Ranges": "bytes", "X-Cache-Hits": "0", "Date": "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 04:37:05 GMT", "Age": "0", "X-Served-By": "cache-sjc3628-SJC", "Content-Type": "text/html", "Server": "lighttpd/1.4.28", "X-Status-Code": "404", "X-Cache": "MISS", "Content-Length": "345", "X-Timer": "S1458016625.375814,VS0,VE148", "Via": "1.1 varnish"}
```

### `website.wbcr/1.response_body.dat`

* Contains the contents of the HTTP response body received from the origin HTTP server when obtaining HTTP resource #1.
* Binary file.
